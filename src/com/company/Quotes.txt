First of all, I try to be a positive role model. Bruce Jenner
I always felt that my greatest asset was not my physical ability, it was my mental ability. Bruce Jenner
I didn't only have a perceptual problem, I was also so nervous and so upset. The process just didn't work. I lost enthusiasm for school and I flunked second grade. The teachers said I was lazy. Bruce Jenner
I learned that the only way you are going to get anywhere in life is to work hard at it. Whether you're a musician, a writer, an athlete or a businessman, there is no getting around it. If you do, you'll win - if you don't, you won't. Bruce Jenner
I spent twelve years training for a career that was over in a week. Joe Namath spent one week training for a career that lasted twelve years. Bruce Jenner
I still have nightmares about taking tests. Bruce Jenner
I thought everybody else was doing much better than I was. Bruce Jenner
I was growing up in the 50's and 60's. Back then they didn't even know what dyslexia was. Bruce Jenner
If I wasn't dyslexic, I probably wouldn't have won the Games. If I had been a better reader, then that would have come easily, sports would have come easily... and I never would have realized that the way you get ahead in life is hard work. Bruce Jenner
If you are a kid, reading is really important stuff. Bruce Jenner
If you are dyslexic, your eyes work fine, your brain works fine, but there is a little short circuit in the wire that goes between the eye and the brain. Reading is not a fluid process. Bruce Jenner
If you're asking your kids to exercise, then you better do it, too. Practice what you preach. Bruce Jenner
If you're going to dedicate every second to winning the decathlon, what are you doing wasting your time in bed? Bruce Jenner
It caused more problems as a young kid, because the simple process of perceiving words on a piece of paper was hard for me. Many people think dyslexic people see things backwards. They don't see things backwards. Bruce Jenner
Nobody has milked one performance better than me - and I'm damned proud of it. Bruce Jenner
Our mission for younger people is to do our best to make exercise cool, hip - the thing to do. Bruce Jenner
Start early and begin raising the bar throughout the day. Bruce Jenner
The biggest problem with dyslexic kids is not the perceptual problem, it is their perception of themselves. That was my biggest problem. Bruce Jenner
The truth is everybody does it from time to time. People dial telephone numbers and they get a wrong number only to find that they've read the last two digits backwards. Everybody does it, but dyslexics have this tendency to a higher degree. Bruce Jenner
Waving the flag at the 1976 Olympics wasn't my idea. It was too much apple pie and ice cream. Not that I don't love my country, but I felt it was my victory up there, I put all the time into it. Bruce Jenner
We put so much pressure on kids to excel in school at such a young age. Bruce Jenner
When the time comes for your brain to process the information, the second word comes up faster than the first one. So when it's in your head, all of a sudden, it comes out backwards and you think of the word backwards. Bruce Jenner

And I don't cook, either. Not as long as they still deliver pizza. Tiger Woods
As a kid, I might have been psycho, I guess, but I used to throw golf balls in the trees and try and somehow make par from them. I thought that was fun. Tiger Woods
Don't force your kids into sports. I never was. To this day, my dad has never asked me to go play golf. I ask him. It's the child's desire to play that matters, not the parent's desire to have the child play. Fun. Keep it fun. Tiger Woods
For many my behavior has been a major disappointment, my behavior has caused considerable worry to my business partners, and everyone involved in my business, but most importantly to the young people we influence, I apologize. Tiger Woods

I'm not as far along as Jack Nicklaus was at this age, but I'm trying. Tiger Woods

If you are given a chance to be a role model, I think you should always take it because you can influence a person's life in a positive light, and that's what I want to do. That's what it's all about. Tiger Woods

I am alone, some people help me, but, basically, I can do what I want. Sergei Bubka
The pole vault is a very complicated event, there are many things involved. Sergei Bubka
The strategy of my coach and me was that we looked at pictures of all the best pole vaulters from around the world, and we took the best parts from them, and we created a person that had never existed. We then started to work toward being such a person. Sergei Bubka
And, of course, method is very important as is a high-quality specialist (trainer) working with you to keep you going in the right direction for your improvement and to help create results. Sergei Bubka
Even now I want to keep my amateur spirit, to spend my time, to be in the sport with all my heart. Sergei Bubka
I began with track and field because this is what I know. Sergei Bubka

What is nice about this sport is that I am responsible for most everything. Sergei Bubka
You need to work very hard, you have to spend a lot of time practicing your sport - six to seven hours daily. Sergei Bubka
Pain divides the champion from someone else who is not a champion. That's what most people lack, having the guts to go on and just say they'll go through the pain no matter what happens. Arnold Schwarzenegger
In our society, the women who break down barriers are those who ignore limits. Arnold Schwarzenegger
What we face may look insurmountable. But I learned something from all those years of training and competing. I learned something from all those sets and reps when I didn't think I could lift another ounce of weight. What I learned is that we are always stronger than we know. Arnold Schwarzenegger
The mind is the limit. As long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it, as long as you really believe 100 percent. Arnold Schwarzenegger
Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength. Arnold Schwarzenegger
The resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character. Arnold Schwarzenegger
Training gives us an outlet for suppressed energies created by stress and thus tones the spirit just as exercise conditions the body. Arnold Schwarzenegger

Even if all other competitors have been beaten, the true champion will still be left racing against himself or herself for that ever-elusive pinnacle of excellence - Peter Coe – Winning Running
Why would you not try to be the best person … you possibly can be? Why can’t you push yourself? Why can’t you set goals that are sky high? These are things I don’t understand about some people. You only get one chance at life. Try to be the best you possibly can be. Don’t hide behind others and plod along. Think big, achieve big is my mentality. Kevin Pietersen – England Cricketer
Long distance runners are privy to a special relationship with pain and solitude and grace – Zola Budd

We’re out there. The ones who push you. Then try to push past you. Get you up before the alarm and out sweating. Dark or rain. We give you our best to get the best from you.

Move with us or against us. Together we will make it count.” – Nike
“Quit making excuses, putting it off, complaining about it, dreaming about it, whining about it, crying about it, believing you can’t, worrying if you can, waiting until you are older, skinnier, richer, braver, or all around better. Suck it up, hold on tight, say a prayer, make a plan & JUST DO IT.” – Nike
Somehow we’ve come to believe that greatness is only for the chosen few, for the superstars. The truth is, greatness is for us all.

Greatness is everywhere somebody is trying to find it.” – Nike

It's being creative. - Steve Prefontaine

This is my last year at Oregon, and it means a lot to me. The people have been great to me up there, so if I have to run three races to win the Pac-8 title, I'll do it. Oh, sure, I'll probably be tired, but the people shouting will carry me across the finish line. - Steve Prefontaine

What I like most about track is the feeling I get inside after a good run. - Steve Prefontaine

Distance runners are experts at pain, discomfort, and fear. You’re not coming away feeling good. It’s a matter of how much pain you can deal with on those days. It’s not a strategy.

The only tactics I admire are do-or-die – Herb Elliott
Mind is everything. Muscle – pieces of rubber. All that I am is because of my mind – Paavo Nurmi
